###Python For Loops
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
_Example:_


###if
````
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
````

###Elif
````
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")
````

###Short Hand If ... Else
````
a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")
````
