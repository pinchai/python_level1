# Python Loop Statements

Python provides loops to execute a block of code multiple times. The two main loop types are:
- `for` loop  
- `while` loop  

Python **does not** have a `do-while` loop, but we can simulate its behavior.

---

## **1. `for` loop**
A `for` loop iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, dictionary, string) or a range of numbers.

### **Syntax:**
```python
for variable in sequence:
    # Code to execute
```

### **Example 1: Iterating over a list**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```
**Output:**
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

### **Example 2: Using `range()`**
```python
for i in range(5):  # range(5) generates numbers from 0 to 4
    print(i)
```
**Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

---

## **2. `while` loop**
A `while` loop runs as long as a condition remains `True`.

### **Syntax:**
```python
while condition:
    # Code to execute
```

### **Example:**
```python
x = 5
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
```
**Output:**
```
5
4
3
2
1
```

---

## **3. Mimicking `do-while` loop in Python**
Python does not have a built-in `do-while` loop, but it can be simulated using `while True` with a `break` condition.

### **Example:**
```python
x = 0
while True:
    print(x)
    x += 1
    if x >= 5:
        break
```
**Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

---

## **Loop Control Statements**
Python provides control statements to modify loop execution:

### **1. `break` statement**
Used to exit the loop completely.

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```
**Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

### **2. `continue` statement**
Skips the rest of the loop body and moves to the next iteration.

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```
**Output:**
```
0
1
3
4
```
(Note: `2` is skipped.)

### **3. `else` clause in loops**
Python allows an `else` clause in loops, which executes when the loop finishes without hitting a `break`.

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed successfully")
```
**Output:**
```
0
1
2
Loop completed successfully
```

However, if a `break` occurs, the `else` block is skipped.
