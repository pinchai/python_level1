## Python `if...else` Statement

In Python, the `if...else` statement is used for decision-making. It allows the program to execute different code blocks based on conditions.

### Syntax:
```python
if condition:
    # Code block executed if condition is True
else:
    # Code block executed if condition is False
```

### Example:
```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```
#### Output:
```
You are eligible to vote.
```

## `if...elif...else` (Multiple Conditions)
If there are multiple conditions, use `elif`:
```python
score = 75

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

#### Output:
```
Grade: C
```

### Nested `if`
You can also nest `if` statements:
```python
num = 10

if num > 0:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("Positive Even Number")
    else:
        print("Positive Odd Number")
else:
    print("Not a positive number")
```
